Elon Musk Twitter deal back on in surprise U-turn

Messages reveal how Musk and Twitter boss fell out
There had already been some embarrassing revelations revealed in court documents - such as private messages which showed that Elon Musk and Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal had fallen out, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey had tried to mediate.

Was there more to come during the deposition? It is possible that Mr Musk is buying himself some time and saving face, ahead of a court case that many predicted he was unlikely to win.

The 'everything' app
As for his tweet about "X, the app for everything" - we will have to watch this space. He could well be eyeing something along the lines of the hugely successful Chinese app WeChat. That's a kind of "super app" which incorporates a lot of different services including messaging, social media, payments and food orders - there is as yet no such thing in the west.

Compared with its rivals, Twitter is a comparatively small platform with around 300m monthly users, and it has never experienced the exponential growth of say TikTok or Instagram. But it is considered influential, and is widely used by politicians, world leaders and businesses, to share comment and opinion.

When he first announced his intentions to buy Twitter, Mr Musk said he wanted to open the platform up to more "free speech" and less moderation - a tricky line for any social media firm to walk and keep in line with various regional regulations and laws on hate speech.

While the news is undoubtedly good for Twitter the business, whose shares rose by 20% after the lawyer's letter was revealed, Musk may decide to turn the platform into a very different kind of playground. This could alienate its current fans - but also bring in a whole new crowd. Either way, CEO Parag Agrawal is probably dusting down his CV.
