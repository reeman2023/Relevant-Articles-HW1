Crimean Bridge
The Crimean Bridge (Russian: Крымский мост, tr. Krymskiy most, IPA: [ˈkrɨmskʲij most]), also called Kerch Strait Bridge or Kerch Bridge, is a pair of parallel bridges, one for a four-lane road and one for a double-track railway, spanning the Kerch Strait between the Taman Peninsula of Krasnodar Krai in Russia and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea in Ukraine. Built by the Russian Federation after its annexation of Crimea at the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014, the bridge cost  billion (US$3.7 billion) and has a length of 19 km (12 mi),[d] making it the longest bridge in Europe] and the longest bridge ever constructed by Russia. Besides transportation, Russia intended the bridge to support its claims to Crimea.

In January 2015, the multibillion-dollar contract for the construction of the bridge was awarded to Arkady Rotenberg's Stroygazmontazh. Construction of the bridge commenced in February 2016.[a] The road bridge was inaugurated by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 15 May 2018 and opened for cars on 16 May and for trucks on 1 October. The rail bridge was inaugurated on 23 December 2019 and the first scheduled passenger train crossed the bridge two days later. The bridge was opened for freight trains on 30 June 2020. A record amount of traffic, totaling 36,393 cars, was recorded on 15 August 

The bridge was named the "Crimean Bridge" after an online vote in December 2017, while "Kerch Bridge" and "Reunification Bridge" were the second and third most popular choices, respectively.

On 8 October 2022, at 6:07 a.m. local time, a huge explosion occurred on the roadway leading from Russia to Crimea, starting a large fire and causing parts of the road bridge to collapse.
